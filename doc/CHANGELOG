XMOS Audio DSP example using shared memory and parallel processing.
===================================================================

Release version: 0.6

Firmware
========
* 0.6
Fixed bug (coefficients loaded in wrong order) in assembly version of biquad.
Added Simulator mode for development/debug without HW.
XTA script run during compilation.
Improved structure for github

* 0.5
Replaced Shared memory buffering scheme with communication over streaming channels.
  Block processing is not necessary for Biquad.
  Channels are more efficient for per-sample processing of the stream (saves memory and instructions per sample)
  Note: For shared memory version contact: thomas@xmos.com 
Integrated the latest Biquad Package from https://github.com/xcore/sc_dsp_filters:
  Optimised Assembly Biquad implementation, Saturation

* 0.4 
Improved Equaliser (now using Peak EQ filters)
Increased attenuation of crossover shelf filters
Fixed delay buffers and delays example.
XTA timing checks.
Refactoring and cleanup
Improved README.txt
Added swc_cascaded_biquad package for generating coefficients for lowshelf, highshelf and peak EQ filters

* 0.3
Override Input and output signals with custom signal generators
XScope Probes (real-time oscilloscope-style analysis) in IIC interface code.

* 0.2 
Added Crossover using Low Shelf and High Shelf Filters. Crossover frequency 500 Hz

* 0.1
Added xta timing checks. See README.txt
Increased Biquad BANKS to 5
Activated Cascaded Biquads (they were accidentally disabled in 0.0)
